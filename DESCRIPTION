Description: Generates all necessary C functions allowing the user to work with
    the compiled-code interface of ode() and bvptwp(). The implementation supports
    "forcings" and "events". Also provides functions to symbolically compute
    Jacobians, sensitivity equations and adjoint sensitivities being the basis for
    sensitivity analysis.
