Description: Generates all necessary C functions allowing the user to work with
    the compiled-code interface of ode() and bvptwp(). The implementation supports
    "forcings" and "events". Also provides functions to symbolically compute
    Jacobians, sensitivity equations and adjoint sensitivities being the basis for
    sensitivity analysis. Alternatively to 'deSolve', the Sundials 'CVODES' solver is
    implemented for computation of model sensitivities.
